    <h3>Everyone is welcome!</h3>
    <p>
      Hackerspaces are about community, and we'd like to invite you to come visit 
      ours - free.  There's no restrictions, no fee and no "right" kind of person; 
      If you're interested we'd love to show you what we've built, what we're
      creating, and hear about what you want to make.
      <br>
      We generally open from about 5:30 onwards and will have dinner at around 7 cooked on-site. 
      If you'd like to have some dinner with us please make sure to bring some change as we pass the donations tin around!'
      <br>
      You don't need to be a member to attend this, feel free to come along and socialize, meet people and talk about awesome ideas.
      <br>
