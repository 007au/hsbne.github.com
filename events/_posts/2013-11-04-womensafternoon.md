Hey Brisbane women! If you have ever been interested in checking out
the local hackerspace, now is the time! If you're worried that it'll
be mostly guys, this weekend there is a free women's only afternoon!

You can learn blacksmithing, welding, woodworking, fine jewellery,
electronic garments, 3d printing, quadcopters, robots and all sorts of
other cool things? Come check the place out and see how awesome it
really is. Even if you don't have something to work on, just hanging
out and talking with like-minded people is great! There's always a
project to jump in on if you just want to get involved, or you can
start your own.

Hope to see you there!
