title: Dispute Process

The Executive are not interested in petty disputes among members.  We volunteered to do this because we like doing fun stuff.  Arguments are not fun. Ergo, we will no-longer attempt to deal with member-member disputes “privately” at the executive level.  If member’s can not be mature enough to sort their own stuff out, then we hope they can be mature enough to take advice from someone they respect, and perhaps get it sorted out that way.

That said, the executive is extremely interested in when any member/s break the rules, and we are keen to treat such problems properly and with the full force of the rules.    This means someones membership has been, or will be terminated if rules are broken.    

In case this is at all unclear, the executive have the power to cancel someones membership if they are believed to be breaking the rules. 

The problem is that in many cases it’s not obvious or 100% certain that someone has blatantly disobeyed a rule,  as it may be a “he says, she says” scenario, or simply someone new who doesn’t understand the community boundaries we work under, or other such “borderline” behaviours.  

It has been decided that  the most important rule in this instance is “Be excellent to each other”.  
If *anyone* feels they have been bullied, abused, neglected, mistreated, disrespected (  or any other nasty word )  then it’s quite likely that someone else was not “being excellent”.

These will be refired to as Red Card behaviours,  as used in many sporting circles everywhere.     

As a first action, the executive will publicly Issue a “Red Card”  to the individual, requiring them to immediately cease all current activities, and if onsite require them them to leave the HSBNE premises for the rest of the day or 3hrs whichever is the longest. This is the same as a “cooling off” period in sports, and gives the member time to contemplate their actions, and try not to do it again.  This also gives the executive time to decide if further action needs to be taken ( eg terminate membership, because none of these red things are “being excellent” are they? ) .

To deal with the less egregious issues, or less certain situations  where doubt exists, the executive have decided that they will issue “Yellow Card” warnings as an official caution.    

If people are seen having arguments, raised voices, interfering disagreements, making others uncomfortable or the executive hear indirect reports of unverified/possible Red Card behaviour,  these are all Yellow Card behaviours. They will be issued in the same way as Red Card/s, but it takes two of them in a single day to be “sent home”.  

Both these Card types are “*virtual*”  ( there’s not actual card or paper ) but instead will be **PUBLICALLY ANNOUNCED TO ALL PRESENT, AND PUBLICALLY POSTED ON THE EMAIL LIST**, and additionally at the discretion of the executive it may include a brief one-line description of the [alleged] behaviour that led to the Card being issued.
