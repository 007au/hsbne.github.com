## Overview
This is a master list of policies or by-laws at HSBNE that fall outside the scope of the official HSBNE Rules. These are a working part of the HSBNE infrastructure and social contract. By-laws can be made by vote at a general meeting, or by the Executive Committee[^1].

## Dispute Resolution Process

If two members have a dispute they must first attempt to reconcile it between themselves privately.

If necessary, one or both member/s can then contact the comittee who will attempt ( within 7 days ) to assist in reconciliation of the two parties privately.

If this fails, then either of the members shall formally ( in writing to the executive or secretary ) request the dispute to be heard at a General Meeting as an agenda item, and shall detail precise elements that can be voted on , and ( if necessary ) a general meeting may be called in the normal manner, subject to both members agreeing to attend ( or present their case in writing).

The member/s all shall be given an opportunity to be heard, either orally or in writing. The meeting shall be held, and/or the written statements considered by the members. The members  (all present ) shall then vote on the specifics of the problem,  in the normal way, and  the member/s that are party to the dispute agree to be bound by the group vote.

In case the parties to the dispute can not agree to be bound by the group vote, their remaining option is to terminate their HSBNE membership, in writing to the treasurer or executive , in the usual manner, and have refunded any unused portion of the moneys they may have paid in advance

## Lifetime Membership

Lifetime Members are members of HSBNE who have either accrued 10 years of membership or paid up in advance to accrue 10 years of membership. Lifetime Members do not have to pay for membership to maintain their voting/access rights. Paying in advance is calculated as 

    ( ( 10 * 12 ) - <accrued membership in months> ) * 55

## Stations

HSBNE encourages members to document in-house systems and processes such that they are repeatable, thorough, and usable. To this end, we have the Stations program. The Stations program gives members the opportunity to create a usable piece of infrastructure and be reimbursed by the group for their initiative. This means if you build tooling for the space and it's good enough that anyone can use it, HSBNE can vote to pay you for it's building costs.

A Station must have:

- Usage clearly documented in a manner that anyone can follow without assistance
- Ongoing costs documented
- A member nominated as the maintainer

Documentation for already existing stations are posted on the Wiki and physically at the station itself.

It is reasonable to expect that if you use a station, and break something that is "expensive", and that can not be attributed to wear-and-tear, then you may be asked to fix it, or pay for it, or pay for part/most of it.

All Stations have a "responsible person" who's job it is to ensure it remains usable, that consumables are upkept, that documentation is accurate, etc. This defaults to the person who "authored" it, untill they publish otherwise on the list and in the instructions.   The instructions *must* name this person, and their contact details ( eg phone & email ), so they can be notified in the case of issues, etc. 

All changes to stations ( such as documentation, methodology, systems, etc ) must be "vetted" by the original "author" and/or the current "responsible person".

Please don't break the documentation.   If you are designing a new/better way of doing something, the old system must continue to work until your revisions and documentation are "vetted" and accepted by the author, etc .

If you want to create a new station, these are the steps you’ll need to follow:
- Level 1 Documentation:  Project Proposal -  for "putting it to the group". This does not need firm "costings", but estimates will help your proposal. It is at this point that it is expected that someone unrelated should be able to follow your instructions without help to use the station.
- Level 2 Documentation:  Grant Application - justifiable estimates of the costings, replacement costs, etc. and this is the point at which the ‘station’ must be voted on.
- Level 3 Documentation:  This is the ongoing "living" document for periodic review.  Specifying actual cost/s incurred ( both upfront, and consumables ) and sources for replacement parts/consumeables. 

## Renting

HSBNE has some guidelines around renting space from HSBNE Inc. This is aside from the Shared Coworking Desks beside the Green Room. 

Renting from HSBNE should be considered a privilege, and bestows no rights other than the ability to restrict access to the rented area.

With regards to your rights/responsibilities as both a Tenant and a Member, your rights as a Tenant only apply to the rented area whereas your rights/responsibilities as a Member apply to the entire space.

The current rental rate at HSBNE is **$40/sqm/year**.

When renting with HSBNE, you will be bound by these conditions:

- All storage and equipment etc is 100% at your own risk.
- There is a 30 day notice to leave ( either by request of the executive or by a group vote )
- All rentals are charged at the same rate. If this changes, all rentals will change to suit.
- Ability to rent is a privilege granted to members only. To continue to rent at HSBNE, you must maintain full membership.
- Your rent is always on-top or as-well-as your membership costs.
- Your tenancy/renting from us must have an additional tangible benefit for the group. IE Access to resources/services that we do not have currently.

If you would like to rent space from HSBNE Inc please contact the Executive with your proposal so we can put it to the membership at the next scheduled meeting. Please note this is an action item that will require at least 5 days notice and we generally have our meetings on a Tuesday night.
